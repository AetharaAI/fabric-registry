### Design Elements:

*   **Interwoven "A2A"**: The central feature subtly forms "A2A" from interlocking bands, directly representing the Agent-to-Agent nature of the protocol and its inherent concept of integration and collaboration. This also reinforces the "fabric" idea, where individual threads (agents) form a unified whole.
*   **Woven Fabric/Mesh Metaphor**: The overall knot-like structure strongly evokes a cohesive, resilient fabric or mesh network. This symbolizes robust connections and the seamless flow of information between disparate agents and tools, central to the "Fabric" name.
*   **Subtle Tapered Bands**: Each band features a slight taper, suggesting dynamic movement and the active passing of messages or data, rather than static decoration. This hints at the underlying communication flow fundamental to the protocol.
*   **Inner Shadows at Overlaps**: Very subtle inner shadows are applied where the bands intersect. This adds depth and emphasizes the layered, interconnected nature of the system without compromising the minimalist, flat aesthetic. It visually conveys the idea of distinct entities (agents/tools) coming together to form a greater whole.
*   **Central Dot (Cyan)**: A small, precisely placed cyan dot at the exact center signifies a quiet, non-dominant coordination or registry point. It acknowledges the existence of shared infrastructure (like your public tool/agent registry) but stresses that the protocol itself is distributed and peer-centric, not centralized. It's a subtle nod to discovery and shared knowledge without implying a single point of control.
*   **Color Palette**:
    *   **Deep Graphite (Dark Gray)**: Represents stability, infrastructure, and a serious, technical foundation.
    *   **Electric Cyan (Bright Blue)**: Symbolizes innovation, connectivity, and the active flow of data and intelligence.
    *   **Dark Background**: Provides high contrast, making the logo pop and giving it a modern, cyber-infrastructure feel suitable for CLI tools, dashboards, and API documentation.
*   **Geometric Precision**: Clean lines and a vector-based design ensure the logo scales perfectly from a favicon to large displays, maintaining its sharp, infrastructure-grade appearance.

### Core Message:

The `Fabric` logo is designed to convey:

*   **Robust Connectivity**: Agents and tools are seamlessly linked, forming a unified "fabric."
*   **Distributed Intelligence**: No single point of control, but a network of collaborative entities.
*   **Underlying Infrastructure**: A solid, reliable foundation for autonomous operations.
*   **Open Source Energy**: Modern, technical, and built for the future of agent communication.
